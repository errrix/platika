    "about": "Hello, dear friends and colleagues. My name is Kirill Yashenkov and I am an official candidate of Rugby Union of Russia for the post of President of Rugby Europe. Running for this post was a difficult decision, as in recent years European Rugby has not been developing and descended into stagnation. Some countries have reached their maximum and do not see any ways for further growth, while others cannot progress and move forward. All this happens with almost complete inaction from the governing body, which takes a passive position and just watches from the sidelines. I consider this approach to be fundamentally wrong and therefore I am convinced that European Rugby needs changes. I know what has to be done to get on the path of progress, despite the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic! I rely on your support and hope that together we will take European Rugby to a new level!",
